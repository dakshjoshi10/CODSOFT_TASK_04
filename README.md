# CODSOFT_TASK_04
Here's a simple implementation of the Rock, Paper, Scissors game in Python. It will prompt the user to choose rock, paper, or scissors, generate a random choice for the computer, determine the winner, display the result, and optionally keep track of the score. We'll also include a play-again feature.
Explanation:
get_computer_choice(): Generates a random choice for the computer.
determine_winner(): Determines the winner based on the user's choice and the computer's choice.
display_result(): Displays the user's choice, the computer's choice, and the result.
play_again(): Asks the user if they want to play another round and returns a boolean.
play_game(): The main game loop that handles user input, calls the necessary functions, keeps track of the score, and checks if the user wants to play again.
This script should be run in a Python environment. It provides clear instructions and feedback to the user, making it easy to follow and play the game.
 here's a brief theoretical explanation of the code:

Function Definitions:

get_computer_choice(): This function generates a random choice from 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' for the computer using Python's random module.
determine_winner(user_choice, computer_choice): This function compares the user's choice with the computer's choice to determine the winner. It checks for ties first, then uses the rules of the game (rock beats scissors, scissors beat paper, paper beats rock) to decide the winner.
display_result(user_choice, computer_choice, winner): This function displays the choices made by the user and the computer, and announces the result (win, lose, or tie).
play_again(): This function prompts the user to decide if they want to play another round. It ensures valid input ('yes' or 'no') and returns a boolean indicating the user's choice.
Main Game Loop (play_game):

user_score and computer_score are initialized to keep track of the scores.
The game runs in a while loop:
The user is prompted to choose 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors'. If the input is invalid, the loop continues, asking for a valid input.
The computer's choice is generated.
The winner is determined using determine_winner.
The result is displayed using display_result.
Scores are updated based on the result.
The current scores are printed.
The user is asked if they want to play again. If they say no, the loop breaks, and a thank you message is displayed.
Script Execution:

The play_game() function is called to start the game when the script is executed.
This structure ensures that the game is interactive, user-friendly, and keeps track of scores, providing a complete Rock, Paper, Scissors game experience in the console.

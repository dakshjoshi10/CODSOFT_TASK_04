# CODSOFT_TASK_04
Here's a simple implementation of the Rock, Paper, Scissors game in Python. It will prompt the user to choose rock, paper, or scissors, generate a random choice for the computer, determine the winner, display the result, and optionally keep track of the score. We'll also include a play-again feature.
Overview
The code implements a command-line Rock, Paper, Scissors game in Python. The game allows a user to play multiple rounds against the computer, tracks the scores, and provides an option to play again after each round.

Detailed Explanation
Importing the Random Module:
The random module is imported to enable the computer to make a random choice between rock, paper, and scissors.
Defining Functions:

get_computer_choice():
This function defines a list of choices (rock, paper, scissors).
It returns a randomly selected choice from the list using random.choice().
determine_winner(user_choice, computer_choice):
This function takes the user's and computer's choices as input.
It first checks if the choices are the same, resulting in a tie.
Then it checks for all possible winning conditions for the user.
If none of the above conditions are met, the computer wins.
display_result(user_choice, computer_choice, winner):
This function takes the user's choice, the computer's choice, and the winner as input.
It prints out the choices made by the user and the computer.
It then prints out the result based on the winner.
play_again():
This function prompts the user to decide if they want to play another round.
It ensures the input is either 'yes' or 'no'.
It returns True if the user wants to play again, and False otherwise.
Main Game Loop:

play_game():
Initializes the scores for the user and the computer.
Enters a while loop to keep the game running for multiple rounds.
Prompts the user to choose rock, paper, or scissors. If the input is invalid, it prompts again.
Generates the computer's choice using get_computer_choice().
Determines the winner using determine_winner().
Displays the result using display_result().
Updates the scores based on the winner.
Prints the current scores.
Asks if the user wants to play again using play_again(). If the user says no, it breaks the loop and ends the game.
Summary
The code provides a fully interactive Rock, Paper, Scissors game that runs in the console. It handles user input, generates random choices for the computer, determines the winner, tracks scores, and allows the user to play multiple rounds. The functions are modular and handle specific tasks, making the code organized and easy to understand.
